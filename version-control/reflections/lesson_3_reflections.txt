Q_1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A: In order to share my work with other people or collarborate with other developers on
  the same project, I have to use a remote repo instead of keeping all files local. Moreover,
  when I want to backup some important files, I will also use a remote repo.

Q_2: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  A: When there is no internet connection, I can still view, modify and commit the changes made 
  by other contributors.
