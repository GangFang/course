Q_1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A: In order to share my work with other people or collarborate with other developers on
  the same project, I have to use a remote repo instead of keeping all files local. Moreover,
  when I want to backup some important files, I will also use a remote repo.

Q_2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	A: Because Github would not have bothered to sync every commit automatically. Also, I don't
	want to pull changes that are only small parts of any significant change.

Q_3: Why do I have to fork any repo on GitHub?
	A: The reason I forked in the first place is because you don't have permission to change 
Larry's repository

Q_4: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
	A: When I clone someone's repo to my Github server, I fork;
	when I copy any repo from github or local, I clone;
	when I want to make new changes that will not affect the original project, I use branches.
