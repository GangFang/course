# solutions to problem sets

## Week2 - Problem set 2

### problem 1: Paying The Minimum

```python
# input
balance = 4842
annualInterestRate = 0.2
monthlyPaymentRate = 0.04

# implement the function paymin
def paymin(balance, annualInterestRate, monthlyPaymentRate):
    '''
    Input the following variables: balance, annualInterestRate,
    monthlyPaymentRate as decimals, calculate the balance after 
    one year if a person only pays the mini monthly payment.
    Ouput total paid and the remaining balance.
    
    '''
    # initialize useful variables
    r = annualInterestRate/12.0
    tp = 0
    b = balance
    for m in range(1, 13):
        print 'Month: ' + str(m)
        p = b * monthlyPaymentRate
        print 'Minimum monthly payment: ' + str(round(p, 2))
        tp += p
        b = (b - p) * (1 + r)       # criticial step
        print 'Remaining balance: '  + str(round(b, 2))
    rb = b
    return tp, rb
        
# do the computation 
Totalpaid, Remainingbalance = paymin(balance, annualInterestRate, 
                                    monthlyPaymentRate)
# print out the result
print 'Total paid: ' + str(round(Totalpaid, 2))
print 'Remaining balance: ' + str(round(Remainingbalance, 2))
```

### problem 2: Paying Debt Off In A Year

```python
# input
balance = 3926
annualInterestRate = 0.2

# implement the function guesscheck
def guesscheck(balance, annualInterestRate):
    '''
    Input the following variables: balance, annualInterestRate,
    as decimals, guess and check (by exhausive enumeration) the 
    fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card 
    balance within 12 months.
    Ouput the fixed monthly payment.
    
    '''
    # initialize useful variables
    r = annualInterestRate/12.0
    # guess and check
    # guesses 'lo' generated by exhausive enumeration
    for lo in range(0, balance, 10):    # monthly payment had to be a multiple of $10
        b = balance
        for m in range(0, 12):  
            b = (b - lo) * (1 + r)       # criticial step
        if b <= 0:
            return lo
        
# do the computation 
lo = guesscheck(balance, annualInterestRate)
# print out the result
print 'Lowest Payment: ' + str(lo)
```

### problem 3: Using Bisection Search To Make The Program Faster

```python
# input
balance = 999999
annualInterestRate = 0.18

# calculate the balance after one year
def bal(ans, b, r):
    for m in range(1, 13):
        b = (b - ans) * (1 + r)
    return b
    
# implement the function paymin
def bisection(balance, annualInterestRate):
    '''
    Input the following variables: balance, annualInterestRate,
    as decimals, guess and check (by bisection search) the 
    fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card 
    balance within 12 months.
    Ouput the fixed monthly payment.
    
    '''
    # initialize useful variables
    eplison = 0.001
    r = annualInterestRate/12.0
    lo = balance / 12
    hi = balance * (1 + r)**12 / 12
    ## guess and check
    # guesses 'lo' generated by bisection search
    while True:
        b = balance
        ans = (lo + hi) / 2
        if bal(ans, b, r) >= 0:
            lo = ans
        else:
            hi = ans
        if abs(bal(ans, b, r) - 0) < eplison:
            return ans
        
# do the computation 
ans = bisection(balance, annualInterestRate)
# print out the result
print 'Lowest Payment: ' + str(round(ans, 2))
```
